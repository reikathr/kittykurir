You: Hello!
Watermelon: Hi, there. I keep seeing you around, what are you doing in this neighborhood, mailcat? That's silly, you're probably delivering mail.
You: Yeah, I'm in a bit of a… situation. Scrambled up labels and stuff.
Watermelon: Not sure what that's about, but I can't exactly give out my friends' information.
You: That's understandable…
Watermelon: But I suppose a hint would be fine. Kei's house is somewhere to the left of mine.
You: Oh, thanks a lot!
Watermelon: You're welcome, and good luck.
